Revision history for GLPI Agent Monitor

Future release

* Better error message handling
  The Monitor now displays the error message when displaying error codes.
  The messages are retrieved from Windows in the user's language.
  Also, "GLPI Agent Monitor" is displayed on the error message captions.

* Settings dialog added
  Currently, the only setting available is "New ticket page URL", for
  changing the URL used to create new tickets (i.e. when using Form Creator)
  
* Main window now handles Tab and Esc key pressing
  This is a helpful feature for keyboard-only navigation

1.2.3

* Russian translation added
  Thanks Fedorov Nikolay (@kofe88)

* Spanish (Uruguay) translation added
  Thanks Luis Giordano (@Iruxos)

* Bugfix: Strip quotes when getting server URL from registry
  This removes quotes from the server URL setting, even though the server URL
  should not have any quotes at all.

1.2.2

* Build: Don't sign generated code with an expired code-signing certificate

1.2.1

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug which causes the monitor to display the
  "Screenshot taken" notification every time the systray icon
  changes color if the "New ticket" button was clicked at
  least once in the process' lifetime.


1.2.0

* Agent service control button added on main window
  This button controls the Agent service status. It is a single button
  that stops the service if it's running, starts if it's stopped
  and resumes the service if it's paused. Pause support wasn't
  added as it likely isn't necessary.
  Windows will ask for elevation to control the Agent service.

* Italian translation added
  Thanks Kintaro Oe (@kintaro1981)

* Bugfix (#6): Fixed a bug which causes the Monitor to ignore
  HTTP URLs when clicking the "New ticket" button

* French translation added
  Thanks Guillaume Bougard (@g-bougard)


1.1.0

* "New ticket" button added on main window and right-click menu
  This button opens the "New ticket" page using the URL obtained
  from the "server" parameter of GLPI Agent. It also takes a
  screenshot and notifies the user about it and how to attach
  it to the new ticket.

* "View agent logs" button added on main window and right-click menu
  This button opens the GLPI Agent logfile, as configured in
  the "logfile" parameter. It opens the file directly, so it uses
  your system's preferred log file viewer.


1.0.0
